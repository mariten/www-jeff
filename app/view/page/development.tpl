                <h2>Development</h2>

                <p>I first started programming as a hobby when I was 14 years old and my language of choice at the time was Visual Basic 3.0 (in Windows 3.1).  Over the years as well as through my college Computer Science education and internship, I have come to be proficient with a vast number of languages, technologies, and skills.  These days I use PHP, Java, and JavaScript the most, occasionally making use of Python, Ruby, and C++.  As technology is an ever-changing field, I continue to learn new things and skills with each passing month.  I really enjoy making things and so it is always fun to learn new technologies for my toolbox.</p>
