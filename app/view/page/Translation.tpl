                <h2>Requests</h2>

                <p>At present I am focused on my full-time job as a software engineer, a few established translation clients, as well as various projects in my spare time.  Generally I am not accepting new translation requests.  However, please feel free to contact me and discuss a Japanese to English technical translation project you have and I can direct you to one of my colleagues.</p>
