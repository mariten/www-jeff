                        <h2>About Me</h2>

                        <p>I am a software engineer living and working in the San Francisco Bay Area who spent close to a decade (2006 to 2015) living in Japan.  Originally from Ohio, I graduated from Kent State University in 2006 with a degree in Computer Science and moved to Japan shortly after graduation.  I taught myself Japanese during my initial years there, living in quiet Mie Prefecture (home of Ise Grand Shrine!), and through daily practice I eventually achieved full professional fluency.  In 2011, hungry for exciting new opportunities, I moved to Tokyo which is the heart of Japan's tech sector.  Then in 2015, I transferred to my current employer's US office in San Francisco.</p>

                        <p>I have worked for two major Japanese web services that have millions of daily users.  These large-scale systems demanded fast and stable performance in all facets of their software, so on all my projects I worked hard to make them efficient, robust, and maintainable.  I learned a lot about industrial-grade architecture, reliability, and scalability by getting to work regularly with some of Japan's most talented engineers.  In addition, I did some freelance work during my earlier Japan years, including creating and operating a bilingual online guidebook with content tailored to those living in Mie.  Some of the personal projects I have worked on over the years are detailed on the <a href="/development">development page</a>.</p>

                        <p>When not programming, I am often found looking at maps.  I love exploring â€” finding stunning and/or interesting places, searching for tasty food, or just wandering around somewhere new.  My fondness for exploring naturally lends itself to travel.  I travel when I can and enjoy taking pictures, particularly in Japan, due to the abundance of modern environments, historic scenes, natural beauty, and good food available.  You can see a sample of some of my photos taken there below, or feel free to check out the <a href="/photography">photography page</a> for even more.</p>
