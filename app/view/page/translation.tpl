                <h2>Requests</h2>

                <p>At present I am focused on my full-time job as a software engineer as well as various projects in my spare time, and am generally not accepting translation requests.  However, feel free to contact me and discuss a Japanese to English technical translation project you have and I can direct you to a colleague or in some special circumstances potentially handle it myself.</p>
